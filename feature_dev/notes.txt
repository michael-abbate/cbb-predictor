STARTERS
1. Use boxscore file. Find usual starters by looking at total starts per each player.
2. For game we are predicting, see if we blank boxscores gives us starters?
    ^ I doubt it because we won't know who's starting until game start?
3. May need to use manual inputs of names and/or # starters to:
    3a. Input number key players missing
    3b. Get correct starters season averages
    3c. Other starter info
